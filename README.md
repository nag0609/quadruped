# Gesture-Controlled Quadruped in Gazebo with ROS2

## Team Members:

- Nageswara Rao Janapareddy ,njanapar@buffalo.edu

## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to design and simulate a Quadruped-like robot in Gazebo using ROS2, which can be controlled using full-body gestures (arms, legs, and elbow joints). The robot will be controlled by specific gestures.

## Contributions
This project introduces a simple gesture control system for a robot. It focuses entirely on translating specific human gestures into robot movements. The system will offer a hands-on, interactive way to control the robot using full-body gestures.

## Project Plan

### Set up the Environment:
- Install ROS2 and Gazebo.
- Create a basic workspace for the simulation.
- Set up a simple indoor environment in Gazebo for the robot to navigate.

### Create Gesture-Control Map:
- Define and document gestures that will control the robot’s movements (e.g., hand raised = move forward, arm outstretched = turn left).
- Create a gesture-to-movement mapping document to outline which gestures correspond to which actions.

### Robot Movement Algorithms:
- Write algorithms that map the gestures to specific robot movements in Gazebo.
- Develop basic code that allows the robot to respond to gestures (e.g., move forward, stop, or turn).

### Testing and Refining:
- Test the robot’s movement in response to gestures within the Gazebo simulation.
- Refine the gesture recognition and movement mapping to ensure smooth operation.

## Measures of Success
- The robot should respond accurately to specific gestures (e.g., raising a hand moves the robot forward).
- The robot should function smoothly in the Gazebo environment with gesture-based control.
- A classmate should be able to follow the instructions in the README and successfully run the simulation without assistance.
